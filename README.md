## Blackjack ♠️

At the moment, this program does the bare minimum to simulate the rules of
blackjack, this is effectively how the backend of an electornic blackjack game
should work at a casino.

Also note that the solver is not finished it will always tell you to hit.

## TODO

- Make it a 6 deck shoe to allow for card counting
- Add betting
- Add multiple rounds
- GUI?
